#376 - https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-subsequence/

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle sequence.

A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) are alternately positive and negative.
In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.
A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
